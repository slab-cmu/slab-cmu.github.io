Include your write-up (titled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Lastname_Firstname_hw4.pdf</code>) and a zip/tar folder containing your code. Code will not be graded.</li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2> <p>This class is designed to get you thinking about the ethical implications of NLP and machine learning systems you build. Most NLP and CS students don’t take ethics classes; we want you to think about how you might share concepts you learned in this course even after it finishes. In this assignment, you will demonstrate this critical thinking by designing a homework assignment for the course. You do not have to <em>do</em> the project you describe, but just design it. The goal is to go beyond just modeling approaches and develop a framework for addressing/identifying who benefits or could be harmed from an NLP system, unintended consequences and biases of NLP systems, or using NLP to analyze injustices in society or for social good.</p> <hr> <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2> <p>We’re turning the tables for this assignment: you are an instructor for this class and are designing a homework assignment for students. Again, you do not have to do the project you describe, but just design it.</p> <hr> <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2> <p>First, identify which unit in the course your assignment will be designed around. The units are:</p> <ul> <li>Objectivity and bias</li> <li>Civility in communication (including offensive language, hate speech, trolling)</li> <li>Language of manipulation (including propaganda)</li> <li>Privacy, profiling and security</li> <li>NLP for social good</li> </ul> <p>If you have an idea you’re excited about that you feel fits into the class but aren’t sure which unit it might fit into, check with the instructors or TAs.</p> <p>Your assignment should include learning goals, an overview, specification of a dataset (that currently exists), illustrative examples from that dataset, basic requirements, and advanced analysis. For the goals and overview, think about what you want students to get out of your assignment (this is not trivial). The basic requirements should indicate a dataset and a baseline machine learning model or quantitative analysis. In advanced analysis, list one or more options for novel modeling or analysis, ideally that hasn’t been published before.</p> <p>Your proposed assignment should be sufficiently different from existing assignments and projects in the course. It should also be simple enough to be completed by students in about the same amount of time that you spend on the homework assignments.</p> <p>For inspiration, look to past lectures, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GxKMCP-A4gypu3VsOqKeefIwqSACBHvcFl7pVcaVPLQ/edit?usp=sharing" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reading list</a> from 2020, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PfUU79IyiQUlbENwthkjbg4pTE-hAhXX9p7PwQLTNhg/edit?usp=sharing" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">project ideas list</a>, project ideas you considered but dropped for your class project, current events, and questions/tasks from your own field. Below are a few specific areas and datasets you can consider (remember to include examples from these datasets):</p> <ul> <li>Fake news detection and fact-checking: <a href="http://www.fakenewschallenge.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Fake News Challenge dataset</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07104" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">another dataset</a>, <a href="https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM17/paper/view/15603/14812" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">social networks of fake news</a> </li> <li>Cross-domain hate speech effectiveness with a dataset such as one at <a href="https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/19935" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SemEval 2019</a> </li> <li>Identifying microaggressions: <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1176.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">dataset/paper</a> </li> <li>Comments on TED talk videos labeled for gender of the commenter and gender of the presenter: <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L18-1445.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">dataset/paper</a> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Write-up:</strong> The assignment description should be 1-2 pages in ACL format, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FirstName_LastName_hw4.pdf</code>. Please do not write more than 3 pages. Your proposed assignment write-up should include:</p> <ul> <li>Goals for learning in the assignment</li> <li>Overview</li> <li>Basic requirements, including examples from the proposed dataset</li> <li>Advanced analysis</li> </ul> <p>See the structure of any of the other homework assignments for guidance. You do not have to specify what you are looking for in a write-up or grading.</p> <hr> <h2 id="grading-100-points">Grading (100 points)</h2> <ul> <li>20 points - Submitting assignment</li> <li>60 points - Completing requirements</li> <li>20 points - Write-up is clear, presents meaningful engagement with the course topics, and contains all requested information.</li> </ul> </body></html>
